# What is Conduktor Platform ?

We take the complexity out of Kafka. We give you a platform to build, explore, test, monitor, and collaborate with confidence. 
Simplifying the complexity of real-time data streaming, Conduktor Platform enables leading organizations to improve team productivity and unlock true business value.

## Quickstart
We offer you 3 simple ways to experience Conduktor Platform.

First, we have an online demo. We're using dedicated Kafka cluster with a few applications running in the background.  
You will be able to jump straight into the Platform, no configuration required  
- [I want to try the online demo](#online-demo)

Next, we have a simple docker-compose command, with an embedded Kafka, Schema Registry and Kafka Connect.  
- [Take me to the docker-compose](/example-local)

Finally, if you want to try Conduktor Platform on your own Kafka, 
we have several documentation pages to help you get started.
- [I want to configure Conduktor Platform on my Kafka](Custom.md)
